      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Not sure what to say about myself but, I am currently 
        working as a hair dresser. I have since the age of 18. 
      I'm ready for a change and i have always been intoesting 
    programming. I'm a fairly creative person so iv been teaching 
    myself though game development. And i'v enjoyed every moment so far.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Geraldton, WA. But i have lived most my life in rockingham.

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>It's hard to say I spend most my time gaming. but i have many
        hobbies. I enjoy being outside exploring and camping.
      I also really enjoy art and really anything where i can be creative. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I use to think I knew the answer to this question but i find 
        myself still wondering. Game developments fun i'd be interested 
        in either the art side or programming side. I think im the happyest
        when i am creating. So i guess my dream job is to be creative and 
        to be free and comfterable to do so.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure what I want to do at this point. Web dev does look interesting

      I'm just excited to learn.</p>
